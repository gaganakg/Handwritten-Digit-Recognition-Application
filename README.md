# Handwritten Digit Recognition

An implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Keras, and TensorFlow. This project utilizes a deep neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

- **Data Processing:** The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing, with data normalization applied to improve model performance.
- **Neural Network Architecture:** A simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers is implemented using Keras, designed for digit recognition.
- **Training:** The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.
- **Testing:** Evaluation on the test set provides insights into the model's accuracy and performance.
- **Prediction:** The project includes a functionality to predict handwritten digits from images.

## Usage

1. Train the model by running the training script.
2. Optionally save the trained weights for future use.
3. Use the trained model to predict handwritten digits from images placed in the 'digits' directory.
